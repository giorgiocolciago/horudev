<p>Ciao, sono Sain7.</p>
<p>I am a creative enthusiast, I love to create anything starting from a blank sheet.

In my life I have dedicated myself to many hobbies and passions and I still practice almost all of them today. All my passions have one thing in common, they take place in front of the computer. I studied graphics in high school specializing in UI / UX Design, I studied everything related to programming by myself, starting from the basics of HTML and CSS, managing a database in SQL, up to the code in Javascript, which I am still studying today . I'm not an expert, I'm just a deep enthusiast of digital arts.
