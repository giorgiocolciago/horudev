<h2>Horudev</h2>
<h4>Giorgio Colciago</h4>

Hi, I'm Giorgio.
I created Horudev in 2019 as a trademark of my softwares and my works.

Over time, I felt the need to expand this project.
I felt the need to create a community of artists, developers and content creators from all over the world, with the aim of sharing their skills and their ideas, giving all members of the community the opportunity to create and share material such as for example icons, code, 3D models, music, animations etc .. to be able to earn and at the same time help, and be helped in the development of a project. The community was also born as a place for fun and learning, intent on being a pleasant place to communicate, learn and meet thousands of users who share your same passions.

Whether you are a PRO or a Newbie you will always be welcome.

I am currently working on the community web platform 
- you can visit the site: https://www.horudev.com to check how the work is progressing :] 
- In the meantime you can join the community on Discord by following this invitation link: https://discord./4YzM5bsEe9


We are Legion, Expect Us.
